\section{Conclusion}

The experiment successfully demonstrated the principles of diffraction and the practical applications of grating spectroscopes. By analyzing the emission spectrum of a mercury lamp, we measured distinct spectral lines corresponding to different wavelengths, validated through theoretical calculations. The Rayleigh criterion effectively determined the resolving power, highlighting the importance of precise measurement in optical spectroscopy.
