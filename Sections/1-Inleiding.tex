\section{Introduction}
By examining the diffraction patterns of a light source, valuable insights into its spectral composition can be obtained. This lab report focuses on the principles and applications of diffraction gratings, which separate light into its constituent wavelengths through interference.

The experiment uses a grating spectroscope to analyze the emission spectrum of a mercury (Hg) lamp, highlighting key features such as spectral resolution, intensity distributions, and wavelength measurement. These principles are crucial in various scientific fields, from material analysis to astrophysics, where accurate wavelength determination is essential. This experiment emphasizes the practical application of theoretical concepts to observe and quantify spectral phenomena.
